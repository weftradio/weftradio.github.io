NOTES
=====

- have to get Pure.css out, implement something aligned with the latest via @mdo
- take <article> elements out, I've realized their meaning more and don't want them in.
- implement a component-architecture via user interface elements with corresponding html & css includes; styleguide-as-you-go with these includes.
    __APPROACH__
    - go to each page and list the UI elements - these list items become the component style sheets & markup.
    - this begins to expand the workload, which is the way that Lorri & I can begin working on it together.
    - the underlying thought is about including only the required component styles on a per-page basis. THIS CUTS DOWN ON UNUSED CSS.
    - This means that we need __TO GENERATE & CALL A UNIQUE STYLE SHEET PER PAGE__ **how to execute this?!**
    - This approach is not OBJECT ORIENTED, but rather PAGE ORIENTED.
