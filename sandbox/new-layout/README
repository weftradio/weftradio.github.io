This file, directory, and project started on 2015-01-23.

The idea is to create a new WEFT site general layout template toward the hand-off of when we move to Baltimore in May.

A couple constraints of the project as I'm thinking:
1. move away from the current site's use of Pure.css for layout and UI.
2. easier and plainer markup and css - even if OOCSS
3. documentation to later accompany it.
4. in this early stage, leave room for building on to / off of the output - like make 1) a general layout with content that is all within a container, and 2) content based in a container with sidebars on left and right for different planed outreach campaigns, information outlets for WEFT.
5. build on top of Basscss for faster design.
  5a. I'm still weighing the merits of OOCSS for the organization - need to talk w/ Lorri to see if that style can work w/ her.
