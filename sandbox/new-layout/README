This file, directory, and project started on 2015-01-23.

The idea is to create a new WEFT site general layout template toward the hand-off of when we move to Baltimore in May.

A couple constraints of the project as I'm thinking:
1. move away from the current site's use of Pure.css for layout and UI.
2. easier and plainer markup and css - even if OOCSS
3. documentation to later accompany it.
4. in this early stage, leave room for building on to / off of the output - like make 1) a general layout with content that is all within a container, and 2) content based in a container with sidebars on left and right for different planed outreach campaigns, information outlets for WEFT.
5. build on top of Basscss for faster design.
  5a. I'm still weighing the merits of OOCSS for the organization - need to talk w/ Lorri to see if that style can work w/ her.



Sites of reference that influence the build and design:
- http://www.nypl.org/ -- especially the header above; this is an example of content wholly within a container as well as a container w/ sidebars.

- http://webdesignerwall.com/demo/responsive-menu/ -- this tutorial on responsive nav menu

- http://www.basscss.com/docs/layout/

- http://jsfiddle.net/KCk9y/3/light/ -- this was the reference that helped me achieve a flex-box based dropdown global nav system. After failing with multiple approaches (via my own thoughts and other web references), using these styles worked. My approach to use them was to first write style declarations that made use of css selectors (ie: `nav ul li:hover ul`), which I find visually easier to parse. Then once it was all working, I replaced the raw css selectors with single class names. The reason for not going forward w/ the css selectors route is to avoid issues of specificity. The css selectors route is tied to markup in general; whereas the single-class approach is tied only to a single-class.
  * This resource also contains a contingency plan for browsers that don't support some flex-box declarations.
