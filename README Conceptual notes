We're struggling to create a conceptual framework for presenting WEFT on the public internet.

Everything that will be present on the WEFT website should be backed up by a brief conceptual understanding/narrative/ should be backed up by some amount of text that describes and legitimates its presence by the fact that that text has been accounted for intellectually before the text got there.


Put out a survey to get feedback on the order/priority of site categories & functions

questions can be asked in multiple ways; it can contain a mix of constraint-based questions where I provide the options and the user is forced to consider this particular universe of options, from small to large, AND open-based questions that ask the user to give up their own list categories and functions. The order may be important, which is to say that a hypothesis is that asking the user to first write their 10 top categories of pages of information that should be included on the site will empower them and challenge them to think of what should be. Then the constraint-based questions come, which in a way validates their sense of what they suggested at first by second-ing the commonalities. My further hypothesis is that once the user sees a list of 10 categories, they will have more things to think about which will re-invest back into their first answer and they may even update their first answer.

There can be a series of questions that hone in on particular relationships that I'd like feedback on.
  like one question dealing with a larger amount of categories is "what belongs in the main navigation menu?". A more focused question, given issues I've been thinking about lately (ie: the top 3 priorities to be present on mobile), is, "rank the priority of the following three categories: listen, learn recent plays, support weft"

  does contact belong as a 4th option in the mobile prioritization?


can double up on the rows in the header nav bar, which the old site did.
  Have graphic representatations of information (ie: a carousel, a space for the show playing now, etc.)
